# airport_management_system

This was done as a course project for CS 6400: Database Systems Concepts and Design, Fall 2021. This project includes a comprehensive display of various things that I learned in this course, such as:

1) Constructing an EER Diagram
2) Mapping an EER Diagram to a Relational Schema
3) Creating Tables and Populating the Database. I used 'fake' data, and all the details about creating tables and populating the database are in the file 'create_tables_and_populate_database.py'
4) Making an application. A simple interface was designed and the backend accesses the database and runs queries. Refer to 'app.py'.


The goal of the project was to create a cool application, while improving my understanding of databases. I have made an Airport Management System, which displays certain functionalities that an Airport Manager would be in charge of. The instructions for the set-up and demonstration of the functionalities of the application can be found in the 'instructions.pdf' file.
